## Abstract
Adaptive navigation in unfamiliar environments is crucial for household service robots but remains challenging due to the need for both low-level path planning and high-level scene understanding. While recent vision-language model (VLM) based zero-shot approaches reduce dependence on prior maps and scene-specific training data, they face significant limitations: spatiotemporal discontinuity from discrete observations, unstructured memory representations, and insufficient task understanding leading to navigation failures. We propose DORAEMON (Decentralized Ontology-aware Reliable Agent with Enhanced Memory Oriented Navigation), a novel cognitive-inspired framework consisting of Ventral and Dorsal Streams that mimics human navigation capabilities. The Dorsal Stream implements the Hierarchical Semantic-Spatial Fusion and Topology Map to handle spatiotemporal discontinuities, while the Ventral Stream combines RAG-VLM and Policy-VLM to improve decision-making. Our approach also develop Nav-Ensurance to ensure navigation safety and efficiency.

## Update
ðŸ”¥Weâ€™ve reorganized and cleaned up the repository to ensure a clear, well-structured codebase. Please give the training and inference scripts a try, and feel free to leave an issue if you run into any problems. We apologize for any confusion caused by our original codebase release.
ðŸ”¥Weâ€™ve released some demos.

### âš™ Installation and Setup
1. clone this repo.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/B0B8K1ng/WMNavigation
    cd WMNav
    ```
2. Create the conda environment and install all dependencies.
    ```
    conda create -n wmnav python=3.9 cmake=3.14.0
    conda activate wmnav
    conda install habitat-sim=0.3.1 withbullet headless -c conda-forge -c aihabitat
    
    pip install -e .
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   
### ðŸ›¢ Prepare Dataset
This project is based on [Habitat simulator](https://aihabitat.org/) and the HM3D and MP3D datasets are available [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim/blob/main/DATASETS.md).
Our code requires all above data to be in a data folder in the following format. Move the downloaded HM3D v0.1, HM3D v0.2 and MP3D folders into the following configuration:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ <DATASET_ROOT>
